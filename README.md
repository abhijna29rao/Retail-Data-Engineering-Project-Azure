# Retail-Data-Engineering-Project-Azure (Medallion Architecture)

I worked on an end-to-end Azure Data Engineering project for a retail client. I ingested data from SQL databases and APIs into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 using ADF, then used Databricks with PySpark and Delta Lake to clean and transform it following the Medallion Architecture. I designed a star schema in Azure SQL DB and built Power BI dashboards with DAX for insights. I also implemented data validation, error handling, and cost optimization to ensure the pipeline was reliable and efficient.
